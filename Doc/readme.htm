  <title>FileZilla Server Config</title>
</head>

<body>
  <h3>Why</h3>
  <p>A co-worker manages a Filezilla FTP server on Windows Server 2008.  He
  would like to give a few people the ability to add/delete users and grant
  access rights for various download subfolders.  He showed me the steps he has
  to go through to perform the tasks listed above, and felt it could be
  error-prone for others.  So he gave me the config file ("FileZilla
  Server.xml") as a template to build this application for him.</p>

  <h3>Functionalities</h3>

    <li>Display Config Settings:  </li>
